# Chelsea FC Performance Insights Vizathon

**Author:** Tirdod Behbehani

## Project Overview
In May 2025, I participated in the Chelsea Football Club Performance Insights Vizathon. 
The goal of the exercise was to create a both visually appealing and functional physical performance dashboard
for elite football players and their coaches. A mock dataset was provided by Chelsea FC.
The dataset consisted of four CSVs:
- CFC GPS Data.csv
- CFC Individual Priority Areas.csv
- CFC Physical Capability Data_.csv
- CFC Recovery status Data.csv

I developed my dashboard using **R Shiny**, which was structured around three core modules:
- **Load & Movement**: Track and compare training and match load data.
- **Player Development Priorities**: Highlight key focus areas for individual development.
- **Physical Capability**: Visualize fitness levels and performance benchmarks.

This project was a valuable opportunity for me to improve my skills in web app development, user interface design, and data visualization. 

In future related projects, I aim to:
- Optimize performance by minimizing load times and limit server disconnects
- Improve mobile performance and usability
- Explore alternative platforms such as Streamlit
- Integrate real-time data and allow for data to be input directly into the app
